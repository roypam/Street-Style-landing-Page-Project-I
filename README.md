## What I have learnt By working on this project
1. I have improved my self in reserching on the internet
2. Got a good understanding on selectors
3. Got to know about positioning

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 3 to 4 hours approximately as i was not tracking the time this project was a bit tougher for me from the other ones as it forced me to know how to adjust the image using absolute and relative position
